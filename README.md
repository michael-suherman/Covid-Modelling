# Covid-Modeling

While other countries were being transparent, the Indonesian government decided to hide Covid cases from the public in order to keep the economy strong. When I realized that the Indonesian government was not reporting COVID-19 data accurately,  I was curious what effect this would have on statisticians when they tried to analyze the data and decided to look into it myself. 

I have been taking an advanced statistics course in school for my A levels, and have been self studying various programming languages such as C++ and python for almost 2 years. This issue inspired me to combine my interests in both mathematics and coding to see what impact I could make to the community.

In this code, I attempt to fit COVID-19 cases and deaths into a suitable function and test its acurracy using statistics. I used python libraries, like pandas and matplotlib, to help handle data and plot graphs. I decided to test a normal distribution using a chi test. I also calculated confidence intervals for how long it would take between a patient receiving symptoms to death. I got percentages of 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations away from the mean. Lastly, I modelled the typical pandemic using a SIRD model and compiled all my results together.
